## Scaled-Algencan

This is an adaptation of [Algencan](https://www.ime.usp.br/~egbirgin/tango/codes.php) 3.1.1, a safeguarded augmented Lagrangian solver written by E. Birgin and J.M. MartÃ­nez, which implements the additional option of scaling the final solution as described in

An easy way to incorporate the HSL and Metis packages is also implemented.

## SimpleAL

This is a simple Julia implementation of the safeguarded augmented Lagrangian method for solving nonlinear programming problems, including those with complementarity constraints, described in

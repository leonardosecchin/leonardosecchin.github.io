## Scaled-Algencan

This is an adaptation of [Algencan](https://www.ime.usp.br/~egbirgin/tango/codes.php) 3.1.1, a safeguarded augmented Lagrangian solver written by E. Birgin and J.M. Mart√≠nez, which implements the additional option of [scaling the final solution](https://doi.org/10.1007/s12532-021-00207-9).

## SimpleAL

This is a Julia implementation of the safeguarded augmented Lagrangian method for solving nonlinear programming problems, including those with [complementarity constraints](https://optimization-online.org/?p=31446).

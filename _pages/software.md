## Scaled-Algencan

This is an adaptation of [Algencan](https://www.ime.usp.br/~egbirgin/tango/codes.php) 3.1.1, a safeguarded augmented Lagrangian solver written by E. Birgin and J.M. MartÃ­nez, which implements the additional option of scaling the final solution as described in

> [R. Andreani, G. Haeser, M.L. Schuverdt, L.D. Secchin, P.J.S. Silva. On scaled stopping criteria for a safeguarded augmented Lagrangian method with theoretical guarantees. Mathematical Programming Computation, 2021.](https://doi.org/10.1007/s12532-021-00207-9)

An easy way to incorporate the HSL and Metis packages is also implemented.

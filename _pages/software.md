### [Scaled-Algencan](https://github.com/leonardosecchin/scaled-algencan)

This is an adaptation of Algencan 3.1.1, an augmented Lagrangian solver written by E. Birgin and J.M. MartÃ­nez, which implements the additional option of scaling the final solution, as described in

> R. Andreani, G. Haeser, M.L. Schuverdt, L.D. Secchin, P.J.S. Silva. "On scaled stopping criteria for a safeguarded augmented Lagrangian method with theoretical guarantees", 2020.

An easy way to incorporate the HSL and Metis packages is also implemented. See [https://github.com/leonardosecchin/scaled-algencan](https://github.com/leonardosecchin/scaled-algencan).
